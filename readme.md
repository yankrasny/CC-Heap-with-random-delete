This header contains two functional classes and a test class. The two functional classes are HeapEntry and RandomHeap. Currently neither is templated, perhaps for lack of time and energy (apparently, a master's thesis is no joke). The main contribution here is the ability to delete  an arbitrary element from the heap given a reference to it. This is accomplished by storing for each HeapEntry its position in the heap. The position is updated during swaps (in heapifyUp and heapifyDown) so that a HeapEntry always stores its correct position. The function deleteRandom(int pos) swaps the element at position pos with the last element, and then bubbles down from position pos.
